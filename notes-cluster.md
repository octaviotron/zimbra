votequorum:
Quorum = 2

3rd node just for quorum <-- !

no-quorum-policy property:

    ignore - Do nothing when quorum is lost.
    stop (default) - stop all resources in the affected cluster partition.
    freeze - continue running existing resources, but donâ€™t start any stopped ones.
    suicide - fence all nodes in the affected partition.

The configuration file that holds the quorum-related options of the cluster is /etc/corosync/corosync.conf. All quorum-related options are set in the quorum directive. The default quorum directive in /etc/corosync/corosync. conf without any special options set is as follows:

quorum { 
provider: corosync_votequorum 
}

 The following command shows the quorum configuration.
pcs quorum [config]
pcs quorum expected-votes 2

The following command shows the quorum runtime status.
pcs quorum status

# corosync-quorumtool 
Quorum information 

Remote management (for stonith)
Fujitsu servers have IPMI, HP servers have iLO, Dell servers have DRAC,
IBM servers have RSA and so on
Some are IBM servers mentioning VMK (optional) and others are Fujitsu mentioning iRMC. 
IPMI, iLO, RSA, iDRAC and the like.
Alternatives are switched PDUs, like APC's AP7900.
